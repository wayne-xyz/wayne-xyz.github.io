Welcome to Wayne's Blog! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on technology, development, and life in general.

I've been writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@wayenj) for some time, and now I'm expanding my presence here on GitHub Pages. You'll find both new content and references to my previous work.

Feel free to explore my posts and connect with me through the links below.
